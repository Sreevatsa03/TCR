I would like to thank all the people who stood by my side during my masterâ€™s studies. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor. I am very thankful to Prof. Ali Akoglu for his advice, guidance, comments, and support during this path. Without him, this work would never have been accomplished. I have learnt a lot from him during past two years and his teachings will be always appreciated throughout my career.

I would like to thank Dr.Adam Buntzman who helped me with understanding the medical aspect of the DNA recombination process.

I would like to thank my beloved husband (Mohsen Bahrami) who has been very patient, supportive, helpful, and  understanding throughout this path. Without his supports, it would be almost impossible to start this path. Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents who has been very supportive during past two years.
